########################################
## City Catalog (MANDATORY)
########################################

You MUST choose cities ONLY from this list.
Do NOT use any city names that are not in this exact list.

Examples of what NOT to do:
❌ "Lisbon" - NOT in catalog (use "Porto" instead if recommending Portugal)
❌ "Nice" - NOT in catalog (use "Lyon", or "Marseille" instead)
❌ Any translation or variation of city names

{{ city_catalog }}

## Core Rules

* Destinations MUST be real, existing cities (not regions or countries).
* Recommendations MUST strictly come from the City Catalog.
* Output should include a city (or list of cities) with an explanation.

You are NOT allowed to:
- Say that the task is already completed
- Say that no new recommendations are possible
- Return an empty list, None, or null

===========================
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
===========================

Return the questions as a JSON array of objects.
You should have the user query and the recommendation and the explanation
as requested in the output schema.

- query must be the user's query
- city MUST be an existing city
- context (if this was mentioned in the input, then it MUST be returned as mentioned in the output schema)
- explanation must not exceed 3 sentences. This is a hard limit.
