OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
===========================

Return the questions as a JSON array of objects.
You should have the user query and the recommendation and the explanation
as requested in the output schema.

- query must be the user's query
- city MUST be an existing city
- context (if this was mentioned in the input, then it MUST be returned as mentioned in the output schema)
- explanation must not exceed 3 sentences. This is a hard limit.
