You MUST choose cities ONLY from this list.
Do NOT use any city names that are not in this exact list.

Examples of what NOT to do:
❌ "Lisbon" - NOT in catalog (use "Porto" instead if recommending Portugal)
❌ "Nice" - NOT in catalog (use "Lyon", or "Marseille" instead)
❌ Any translation or variation of city names

{{ city_catalog }}
